Coft-Tech is a renowned IT company majorly working on Software as a Service model (SaaS). They want to revamp their web platform. Coft-Tech majorly deals in IT and sells their IT services as well as different IT software/products following a SaaS model. 

The client specifically instructed your company to design an aesthetically pleasing landing page (first page) with a slider showing different IT related punch lines and images. The landing page should be linked to different products page per their respective category, i.e., there can be multiple categories and each category can have multiple products. The look and feel of a product will be same therefore you are required to design only one product page. The categories and their respective products should appear as drop-down menus (use bootstrap utility classes for this purpose). There should be a category page such that each category should display all products within a category. Since the look and feel of each category page will be same therefore design only one such page. 

The first/landing page should have a slider as described above, also, the page should have different packages showing details of a product like normal packages will be cost effective however will include limited services, premium packages will cost a little higher and include more services and so on. Design 4 packages, where each package should include a product image, description, price, and service details in the form of a bullet.

You are required to implement an about us page, contact us page along with a photo gallery page which will hold thumbnails of different photos of the organizational events. The gallery should be arranged per event. 

You are required to design the admin panel as well keeping in mind all the above-mentioned functionalities as the admin is required to add, delete and update the details without changing the code of the website. Therefore, you are required to design the forms accordingly.
